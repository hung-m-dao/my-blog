# Collector's fallacy
<h2>What is it ?</h2>
<p><strong>Collector’s Fallacy</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> is the urge to collect something that you never use or need, but the act of collecting gives you a good feeling.
The sciene behind this, is,  each time we discover a new productivity toy, our brain sends us a jolt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a> (our brain’s “reward” hormone)</p>
<h2>How to avoid it</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Own&quot; before you collect</li>
</ul>
<p>Think it through before making any decision, take it slow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Purging</li>
</ul>
<p>Get rid of things you don't really touch. My rule of thumb: If you haven't used it in a year, throw it away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring</li>
</ul>
<p>Always keep track of what you already have, remind yourself of the old items, this might help reduce the need of collecting new stuffs.</p>
