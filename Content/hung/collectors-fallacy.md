# Collector's fallacy

## What is it ?
**Collector’s Fallacy** is the urge to collect something that you never use or need, but the act of collecting gives you a good feeling.
The sciene behind this, is,  each time we discover a new productivity toy, our brain sends us a jolt of [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) (our brain’s “reward” hormone)

## How to avoid it
####  "Own" before you collect
Think it through before making any decision, take it slow.

####  Purging
Get rid of things you don't really touch. My rule of thumb: If you haven't used it in a year, throw it away.

####  Measuring
Always keep track of what you already have, remind yourself of the old items, this might help reduce the need of collecting new stuffs.
